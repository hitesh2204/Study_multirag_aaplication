The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held in India, organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It is held annually since the first edition in 2008.[1] Kolkata Knight Riders were the defending champions, having won their third title in the previous season after beating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[2].
According to ESPNcricinfo, the dates of the tournament window for the three seasons between 2025 and 2027 were sent to franchises ahead of the 2025 auction.[7] In November 2024, the tentative dates for the three seasons were announced, with the 2025 edition set to take place from 14 March to 25 May.[8] In January 2025, it was announced that the 2025 season would commence on 21 March to allow for a two-week gap after the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final scheduled to take place on 9 March.[9] This led to a clash with the 2025 Pakistan Super League taking place from 11 April to 25 May 2025,[10] which was moved from its typical February–March window for the same reason.[11]

The first two matches were confirmed by the BCCI on 13 February 2025, with the inaugural match being hosted at the Eden Gardens between the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on 22 March.[12] The complete fixtures were announced on 16 February.[13] It was announced that both Qualifier 1 and Eliminator would be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on 20 and 21 May, and that Qualifier 2 and final would be played at the Eden Gardens on 23 and 25 May, with the venue to host its third IPL final after 2013 and 2015.[14].
The 2025 Indian Premier League, also known as IPL 18 and branded as TATA IPL 2025, was the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League, a professional Twenty20 cricket league. The tournament featured 10 teams competing in 74 matches. It began on 22 March and was held across 13 venues before being suspended on 9 May due to the 2025 India–Pakistan crisis. The matches resumed from 17 May across six venues, with the final rescheduled from 25 May to 3 June.

The defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders were eliminated in the league stage. In the final, Royal Challengers Bengaluru defeated Punjab Kings by 6 runs to win their maiden title after 18 years. Sai Sudharsan and Prasidh Krishna of Gujarat Titans scored the most runs (759) and took the most wickets (25) respectively. Suryakumar Yadav of Mumbai Indians was awarded as the most valuable player of the tournament.
